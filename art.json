The 2021 census said 2.1 million Nepalis lived abroad, but realistically three times more live, work and study overseas.\n\nBeing breadwinners also makes them decision makers for families back home. Most have left because they could not get meaningful jobs and sought opportunities abroad, which means they are not happy with the way Nepal has been governed by the established parties and leaders.\n\nThe diaspora is therefore mostly an anti-incumbent vote bank, which was one reason the political leadership blocked out-of-country voting for so long – despite a Supreme Court ruling that all citizens had a constitutional right to vote, wherever they lived.\n\nIn the 2022 polls, overseas Nepalis had already shown considerable influence by backing newer and alternative candidates like Balendra Shah for Kathmandu mayor, and parties like the RSP.\n\nIn the four years since, and especially since the GenZ movement, support for a political shakeup has grown even stronger."

When Sheikh Hasina fled Bangladesh on 5 August 5 2024, following a student-led revolution in which over a thousand people lost their lives, the country was not simply between governments."
